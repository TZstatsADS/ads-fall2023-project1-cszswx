### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Project title: EDA in words using by people when they are happy.
+ This project is conducted by [Jianjie Sun]

+ Project summary: This exploratory data analysis aims to dig the underline pattern of people's words using when they are happy. Understanding what makes people happy is essential to augment positive experiences. HappyDB, a crowd-sourced collection of 100,000 happy moments makes the analysis come true. In the analysis, I applied data mining, statistical analysis and visualization to the data. Hope that this is an interesting project.
